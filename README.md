#Speedy

Speedy (I hope DC Comics won't sue me because of this name) is speed typing multiplayer game. It is build on reactjs, and I use webpack as my bundler and babel as the compiler.

## Installation

simply type this command in the terminal `npm i -S` or `npm install --save` which totally mean the same thing. And then `npm start`, now the server will run on port 3000. Finally open `http://localhost:3000/webpack-dev-server/`, that's it.

## Notice

I am currently working on this, and it's a school project but I just decided to make it open source from the beginning because I might not have time later. Feel free to fork but no pull requests till May 2016. Thanks.
